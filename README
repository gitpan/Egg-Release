Egg::Release - WEB application framework.
=================================================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

* Module::Install is used.

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Install'

1. To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   or

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

2. Create your project files.


   ## Helper script is generated.
   
   perl -MEgg::Helper -e "Egg::Helper->out" > /path/to/egg_helper.pl
   
   chmod 755 /path/to/egg_helper.pl
   
   * We will recommend environment variable PERL_PATH to be set before
     the above is executed.

   # export PERL_PATH=/usr/bin/perl


   ## Project is generated.
   
   /path/to/egg_helper.pl Project:[PROJECT_NAME] -o [/path/to/output]
