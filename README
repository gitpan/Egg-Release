Egg::Release - WEB application framework.
=================================================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

1. To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   or

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

2. Create your project files.

   perl eg/install-helper.pl -o /path/to/bin

   /path/to/bin/egg_helper.pl project -p [PROJECT_NAME] -o [/var/www]

   * We will recommend environment variable PERL_PATH to be set before
     the above is executed.

   # export PERL_PATH=/usr/bin/perl

   * It is an action method when 'install-helper.pl' is not found.

   perl -MEgg::Helper::Script \
    -e 'Egg::Helper::Script->out' > install-helper.pl

   * Please make script when it is useless by all means.
   ----- install-helper.pl -------------
   use Egg::Helper::Script;
   Egg::Helper::Script->run('install');
