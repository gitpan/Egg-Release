Egg::Release.
=================================================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.


  >>> WARNING <<<
  The specification has changed a little with the VERSION 2.X system.
  When the upgrade is done, the WEB application that has already operated
  is influenced harmfully.
