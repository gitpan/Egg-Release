=item * Loading of Egg

Egg is read with use and the plugin and the flag that wants to load it by the
argument are passed.

  use Egg qw/
    -Debug
    ConfigLoader
    Encode
    Upload
    Tools
    Dispatch::Standard
    Debugging
    Log
    FormValidator::Simple
    ErrorDocument
    DBI::Transaction
    +MyApp::Plugin
    /;

Because the method such as 'dispatch' and 'debug' and 'log' that Egg demands
is included as for 'Dispatch::*' and 'Debugging' and 'Log', it is necessary to
load it.

In addition, please refer to the document of L<Egg> for details.

=item * Initialization of Egg.

The configuration of an appropriate place is loaded by ConfigLoader in default.
Please refer to the document of L<Egg::Plugin::ConfigLoader> for details.

However, if it is not a platform where the perpetuity objects such as mod_perl
and FastCGI are treated, it always costs the behavior cost in initial operation.
To evade this, the configuration is passed directly to 'egg_startup'.

  __PACKAGE__->egg_startup({
    title => 'project_name',
    .....
    ...
    .
    });

Please refer to the document of L<Egg> for a set item of Egg.

=item * Dispatch ‚ÌÝ’è

The setting for loaded Dispatch is set up by 'run_modes'.

    .
    );

Please refer to the document of L<Egg::Plugin::Dispatch::Standard> and
L<Egg::Plugin::Dispatch::Fast> for details for the setting method.

Additionally, Egg does a little tricky processing that adds the plugin and
oneself to controller's @ISA.
Therefore, the method of the addition to the controller is given to priority
more than any module included in controller's @ISA.

$e-E<gt>next::method is used to process it of returning the method of other 
modules to former processing after override is done as a controller.

     my($e)= @_;
